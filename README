This script allows you to browse (read) email from a standard Berkeley mbox formatted mail file.  When you type :Mail or :Mail <filename>, it will scan the file for headers, extract them, and present you with a list of the mail items present in the file.  You can easily select mail items to view.  It does not (as yet) allow you to send mail in any form, or to delete mail from the mailbox.

See the script for more detailed usage information.
